## Custom Command: `lsx`

`lsx` is an extended version of the `ls` command that shows each file or directory on a separate line along with its size and creation date/time.

* **Usage:**

  ```bash
  lsx          # List visible files with size and creation date/time
  lsx -a       # List all files including hidden ones with size and creation date/time
  ```

* **Example output:**

  ```
